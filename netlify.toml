# Environment variables that need to be set in Netlify dashboard:
# FIREBASE_API_KEY, FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN, FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL, FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
# FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET, FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID, FIREBASE_APP_ID
# OPENROUTER_API_KEY
#
# Note: Environment variables set in the Netlify dashboard are automatically
# available to functions via process.env at runtime. The functions have been
# updated to initialize Firebase inside the handler (not at module load time)
# to ensure environment variables are properly available.
